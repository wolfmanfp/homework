Controlling a simulated robot using WASD keys.

This project is based on:
* [MooreRobots' beginner tutorial](http://moorerobots.com/blog/post/1)
* [Turtle keyboard teleoperation code](https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/blob/kinetic-devel/turtlesim/tutorials/teleop_turtle_key.cpp) from the official [ROS tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics)

I also used the [pysdf](https://github.com/andreasBihlmaier/pysdf) library to convert my Gazebo model into URDF format.
