# Webstar Katedra 2015

This repository contains all homeworks from [Webstar Group's](https://github.com/wbstr) [Java programming course,](https://github.com/wcs-katedra) submitted via GitHub.
The main purpose of this course was developing a Lean Poker player bot. You can check the source code of our team's (Team Alpha) bot here: https://github.com/wcs-katedra/poker-team-alpha.

### StringCalculator
It takes two numbers as strings and adds them together. There are two different versions with JUnit tests in this repository.

### FizzBuzz
Original description: "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"."
This project was originally forked from [wcs-katedra/fizzbuzz](https://github.com/wcs-katedra/fizzbuzz). You can check Webstar's implementation here: https://github.com/wcs-katedra/fizzbuzzimpl.
